# Prompt: Generate a Python-based Biomedical Data Ingestion System (HerpAI-Ingestion)

Using the specifications in the README.md file as your primary reference, create a complete Python implementation for HerpAI-Ingestion, a flexible and scalable system for ingesting, processing, and storing biomedical data from various sources.

## Implementation Requirements:

1. Create a separate Python file for each class (e.g., `connector.py` for the `Connector` class, `document_repository.py` for the `DocumentRepository` class). Do not combine multiple classes in a single file.

2. Maintain a clean, organized directory structure that reflects the architecture in the README.md.

3. Follow the architecture, component structure, and interfaces defined in the README.md exactly.

4. Implement each module as described in the documentation, including:
   - The Connector SDK with interfaces and base classes
   - The data processing pipeline with extraction, transformation, and loading phases
   - The domain model and repository pattern implementation
   - The storage system supporting multiple backends
   - The scheduling system and CLI interface

5. Ensure your code is a precise implementation of the system design documented in the README.md, with all class names, method signatures, and component interactions matching the specifications.

6. For each file you generate, include:
   - Proper imports
   - Complete class implementation
   - Docstrings explaining the purpose and functionality
   - Type hints for method parameters and return values

When generating the code, explicitly reference sections from the README.md to demonstrate how your implementation satisfies the specified requirements.

For each component, explain how it interacts with other parts of the system and how it contributes to the overall architecture.
